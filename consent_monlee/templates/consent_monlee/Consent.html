        <li>
        I agree to take part in the Monash University research project mentioned above.
        I have had the project explained to me, and I have read the Explanatory Statement, which 
        I might keep for my records. 
        </li>
        <li>
        I understand that the points I earned through the session will be converted to cash
        at the end of the session. The final amount to be paid may depend from my choices, other participants' decisions, and chance. 
        </li>
        <li>
        I understand that my participation today is voluntary, that I can choose to not to participate in part or all of the session, 
        and that I can withdraw at any stage without being penalised or disadvantaged in any way, though if I do so I will not get paid.
        </li>
        <li>
        I understand that the de-identified data from this experiment may be made available to other researchers for the scientific purposes
        of verification and further analysis, including future research projects. <b> No identification that would allow identification of myself will be shared</b>
        </li>
